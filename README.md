# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A simple machine learning project to predict house prices based on features like overall quality, living area, number of rooms, etc. This project uses a regression model trained on real housing data.

## Features

- Predict house prices using input features
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Trained with a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest)
- Interactive prediction via Streamlit web app (optional)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for optional web UI)
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
